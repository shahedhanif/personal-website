            <h1>Brief Autobiography</h1>
            <p>My name is Shahed Hanif. I was born on the 17th of Shawwal 1422 A.H. [January 1st, 2002 A.D.] in Dhaka and moved to the U.S. a few months later. Currently, I work as a software engineer and spend most of my free time benefitting from classes at Masjid Daar At-Tawheed Wa Sunnah.</p>
            <p>Some of my teachers that I benefit from in-person are Abu Abdil Maalik Abdul Haqq, Imam of Masjid Daar At-Tawheed Wa Sunnah, and Ustadh Yusuf Price, an Al-Azhar Graduate with years of experience teaching Arabic to non-native speakers.</p>
            <p>I am also enrolled in a self-paced student of knowledge program at AMAU Academy with Ustadh Abdulrahman Hassan and Ustadh Muhammad Tim Humble.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes I find myself benefitting from recordings of lectures given by a number of Shuyukh such as Shaykh Abu Mujahid Fareed Abdullah, Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, and Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan. May Allah have mercy on them all and the ones I didn’t mention.</p>
            <h2>Intentions</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life, I’ve gone down way too many paths. As a result of one of these paths, I found myself gravitating towards Islam more over the past few years than I have in the last two decades or so of my life.</p>
            <p>The problem was, I was struggling to hold onto what little remained of my Muslim identity while living in a secular society that seeks to gobble it up faster than the blink of an eye.</p>
            <p>I think many of us, including me, forget to ask ourselves who we are, why we’re here, and what we stand for. And growing up pressured to thrive in a very rotten and materialistic environment, often at the cost of our religious obligations, didn’t help facilitate a deeply introspective examination of such existential questions.</p>
            <p>That’s why I created this site to share some of what gets me out of the bed every morning and to organize my mind outside the crowded space of social media. I hope my writing will serve as a reminder of my purpose and goals in life. May Allah make our intentions sincere and accept it.</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, I'm working on developing the skills needed to solve multidisciplinary problems with a focus on the intersection between physics, engineering, and computer science. Part of the motivation is so that I don’t become obsolete in the job market and complacent with my lack of contribution to society.</p>
            <p>I have a long ways to go in this regard, but after I clear some of life’s hurdles I will arrive on the scene preferably without my pants down, or in other words, with knowledge. In short, I’m going to stay learnin’, stay earnin’, and stay contributin’.</p>
            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>I am not knowledgable or pious, I am merely a weak servant of Allah who strives to act upon the teachings of Islam and limit the scope of my writing to that which I’ve learned and taken time to apply myself. </p>
            <p>Needless to say, I try my best to learn from people of knowledge within my community and through reliable resources. May Allah make it easy for us to seek knowledge and guide us to the truth.</p>
            <p>As for my blog, most of the time it is a soliloquy and I’m discussing something insignificant, but if I’m willing to share it then it is most likely part of a bigger picture.</p>
            <p>And once in a blue moon, I intend to post a thoroughly researched and validated guide that contains practical advice and wisdom on a particular topic. I’m not reinventing the wheel, I just synthesize information for clarity, understanding, and to build a solid foundation to stand on before treading through the different paths of life.</p>
            <p>If you have any issue with the contents of the work I upload, then feel free to email me with a response and if necessary, with clear evidences based on what Allah and His Messenger said. Other than that, don’t dwell too much on my half-researched and unqualified commentary on matters of this temporal world. Afterall, we all act on the basis of an imperfect understanding of reality.</p>
